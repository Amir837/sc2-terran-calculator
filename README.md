# SC2 Terran Economy Simulator

A simple simulator for StarCraft 2 Terran economy growth.

## What it does

Simulates the basic economic flow: continuously producing workers and expanding to new bases.

The simulation follows this pattern:
1. Fully saturate the current base (16 workers on minerals and 6 on gas)
2. Expand to a new base
3. Saturate the new base
4. Repeat

This helps visualize how non-stop worker production and timely expansions affect your mineral income over time.
